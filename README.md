# vite-plugin-mix

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/vite-plugin-mix)](https://npm.im/vite-plugin-mix)

## Motivation

Writing front-end and back-end API in a single project allows faster development (imo), this plugin essentially brings Next.js' API routes to your Vite app.

## Install

```bash
npm i vite-plugin-mix -D
```

## Usage

`vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import mix from 'vite-plugin-mix'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    mix({
      handler: './handler.ts',
    }),
  ],
})
```

`handler.ts`:

```ts
import type { Handler } from 'vite-plugin-mix'

export const handler: Handler = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.path === '/hello') {
    return res.end('hello')
  }
  next()
}
```

The `handler` runs before serving static files, so you should make sure to call `next()` as a fallback. You can also use express-compatible middlewares in the handler.

To start developing, run the command `vite` as usual.

To create a production build, run the command `vite build` as usual.

Now `vite build` will create a server build to `./build` folder alongside your regular client build which is the `./dist` folder by default. To run the production build as a Node.js server, run `node build/server.js`.

## Adapters

### Node.js

By default the server is built for Node.js target, you can run `node build/server.js` after `vite build` to start the production server.

By default the server runs at port `3000`, you can switch to a custom port by using the `PORT` environment variable.

### Vercel

To build for [Vercel](https://vercel.com), use the `vercelAdapter` in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import mix, { vercelAdapter } from 'vite-plugin-mix'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    mix({
      handler: './handler.ts',
      adapter: vercelAdapter(),
    }),
  ],
})
```

Then you can run `vite build` to build for Vercel.

## Guide

### Using express middlewares

```ts
// For example: using the compression middleware

import createCompression from 'compression'

const compression = createCompression()
export const handler = [compression]
```

`handler` could be a single middleware or an array of middlewares.

### Using Apollo GraphQL

```ts
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server-micro'
import { typeDefs } from './schemas'
import { resolvers } from './resolvers'

const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers })

const GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = '/api/graphql'

const apolloHandler = apolloServer.createHandler({ path: GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT })

export const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.path === '/api/graphql') {
    return apolloHandler
  }
  next()
}
```
